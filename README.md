# Resturant-Capstone-IBM
This Jupyter Notebook is mainly used for the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project.
A client seeks to establish a franchised Asian restaurant, with a niche in Southeast Asian cuisine, in a Toronto neighborhood. Which neighbourhood would appear to be the optimal and most strategic location for the business operations?
The objective of this capstone project is to locate the optimal neighborhood for operation. Our foundation of reasoning would be based on spending power, distribution of ethnic group, and competition, across each neighbourhood. We will mainly be utilizing the Foursquare API and the extensive geographical and census data from Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal.
