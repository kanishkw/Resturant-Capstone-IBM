    "A client seeks to establish a franchised Asian restaurant in a Toronto neighborhood. Which neighbourhood would appear to be the optimal and most strategic location for the business operations? The objective of this capstone project is to locate the optimal neighborhood for operation. Our foundation of reasoning would be based off of spending power, distribution of ethnic group, and competition, across each neighbourhood. We will mainly be utilizing the Foursquare API and the extensive geographical and census data from Toronto's Open Data Portal"
